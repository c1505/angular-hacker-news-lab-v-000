call splice instead of slice to remove elements from array while returning a new one?

probably will have to load posts from a different template

Use relevant Directives to bind ViewModels and Events for what?

probably should be more of a get item than getstory




IN PROGRESS
link to post from index
** **
params from route
arr.slice(0, 30) is base
arr.slice(input, 30) where input is page number * 30
extract out method from controller into a service so it can be used easily in the ui router


Allow the user to navigate "Next" and "Previous" page


Use dynamic views in routes
Use relevant Directives to bind ViewModels and Events
Use routing resolves to preload data fetched from Services
Show all comments for a post in the news item
Nest replies to comments where necessary
Display dates in human-readible formats


DONE
route, controller, and view for post show
Render the top stories view
Use ui-router for advanced routing
Set the top stories view as the default route
Create relevant Controllers and Services
Allow a user to transition to a news item when clicked
